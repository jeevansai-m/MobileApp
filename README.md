# restaurant_Table ordering
I've utilized the flutter and dart  programming languages.To create an app, I used flutter launcher icons, geocoding, network image, geolocator, vibration, and splash screen.
In this app, you may examine restaurants, their addresses, and your present locations. By clicking a restaurant, your phone will vibrate and show you where you are.
